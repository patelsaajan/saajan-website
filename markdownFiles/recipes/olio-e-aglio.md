    story: ["This isn't the kind of meal you'd want to prepare for a date, at least not for one of those early dates. However, it's definitely a quick and easy dish that bangs. This is not a reflection of my personal life fyi i dont go on dates too busy with the creaft. ", "I turned to this dish when my university flat was completely empty, and I couldn't be bothered to walk to the shops, which were just a 3-minute stroll away.", "If you want a garlic overload then id suggest making home made garlic bread to serve go with it as well."]

<p>To be honest, the best way to make this one is to go with the flow and use whatever leftovers you have in your kitchen. It's the kind of recipe where you just toss things in and figure it out as you go along.
