    ingredients: ["400g firm tofu", "light soya sauce", "lime/lemon/rice vinegar", "bulb of garlic", "finger chilis", "peanut butter", "gojuchang", "vegetable oil"]
    story: ["The inception of this dish dates back to my final year in university when I was immersed in exam preparations. After a long day of studying, I often sought relaxation through cooking something new in the evenings. One night, I entered my kitchen and found myself with limited ingredients, primarily tofu, peanut butter, and gochujang, which sparked my culinary creativity.", "Intrigued by the potential, I quickly looked up a few recipes for inspiration. The dish underwent further refinement when my flatmate, Finn, returned to the flat. Since then, it has remained relatively unchanged. Caroline Kelly has even described it as her favorite among all the dishes I've cooked for her.", "What I particularly appreciate about this dish is its simplicity, combined with the warm and satisfying feeling it imparts. Moreover, the thickness and stickiness of the sauce offer a delightful and enjoyable eating experience, in my opinion.", "The dish remained nameless for an extended period, briefly going by the title of 'Korean Satay Sauce' which didn't quite capture its essence. The name comes from a song by Giggs and Dave and theres not much more to it then that."]

Coding has been a longstanding interest of mine. I initially chose my degree program with the expectation of learning Python alongside other engineering skills. However, regrettably, Python was removed from the syllabus. Throughout my degree, I did manage to acquire some Python skills, along with MATLAB, which provided a strong foundation for most programming languages. In my spare time, I made attempts to explore other languages like Swift and JavaScript, but often found it challenging to allocate enough time while balancing my coursework.

<p style="margin-top:20px">
In September 2023, I was initially set to start my first job, but it got postponed. I took this as an opportunity to join some friends for a journey through Asia. I also viewed it as a chance to dedicate some of my free time to further developing my coding skills and pursuing my interests in various languages, both expanding my knowledge and honing the ones I already knew. This website was conceived and developed during my travels, reflecting this period of exploration and learning.
